# BioStructBenchmark

TODO: A tool for identifying the differences between two sets of structures, in particular DNA-protein complexes.
Built primarily for identifying systematic differences between experimentally determined structures and computationally
predicted structures generated by programs such as alphafold3.

Incorporates:

-Structure Alignment
-RMSD calculation and decomposition
-consensus error mapping (for working with datasets featuring incidental mutations)
-Principal Component Analysis
-DNA Geometry Analysis using CURVES+
## Installation

To install BioStructBenchmark:
```bash
pip install biostructbenchmark
```

## Development

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reliable package management.

To set up the development environment:
```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and install with dev dependencies
git clone https://github.com/BioStructBenchmark/BioStructBenchmark.git
cd BioStructBenchmark
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Format and lint code
uv run black .
uv run pylint biostructbenchmark
```
